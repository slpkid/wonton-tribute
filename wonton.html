      <h2 class="step">The History of Wonton</h2>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Yang Xiong from the western Han dynasty mentioned "bing wei zhi tun," 
          which means wontons are a type of bread. The difference is that wontons 
          have fillings inside and are eaten after being steamed or boiled.
          Ancient Chinese thought wonton were a sealed bun, lacking "qi qiao" 
          ('seven orifices'). So it was called "hun dun" (混沌), which means 'turbidity'
          or 'chaos.'</p>
          <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Based on the Chinese method of making characters, the radicals 
          are changed from water to food; then, they became "hun tun" (餛飩, wonton in
          Cantonese). At that time, wonton had no difference from dumplings.</p>
          <p style="text-indent: 25px;">For hundreds of years, dumplings had not changed, but wontons 
          became popular in southern China and developed a distinct style. 
          From the time of the Tang dynasty, people began to differentiate the 
          names of dumplings (jiaozi) and wontons.

        <ul>
          <li>Lay out the wonton wrappers on a clean surface.</li>
          <li>Place a small amount (about 1 teaspoon) of the filling in the center of each wrapper.</li>
          <li>Moisten the edges of the wrapper with water and fold it over to form a triangle. Press the edges to seal, ensuring there are no air pockets.</li>
        </ul>
      <h2 class="step">Step 3. Shape the Wontons</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Bring the two bottom corners of the triangle together, sealing them with a bit of water to create the classic wonton shape.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sugar, and chopped green onions. Set aside.</li>

          <li>Carefully add the wontons in batches, frying until they are golden brown and crispy, about 2-3 minutes per batch. Use a slotted spoon to remove and drain on paper towels.</li>
        </ul>
      <h2 class="step">Step 6. Serve!</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Arrange the cooked wontons on a serving platter and garnish with additional chopped green onions.</li>

      <h2 class="step">Wonton Trivia!</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>In Chinese, wonton means “swallowing clouds”. If you are familiar with Chinese art you may also find that the wonton, floating in the broth, resembles the traditional “spiral cloud” motif in Chinese handicrafts. One famous example: The Torch for the Beijing Olympics is known as the “Lucky Cloud Torch” in Chinese.</li>
        <li>The Shanghainese wonton is also folded into a triangle, but a slight twist in the second folding gives it a lovely shape. For the Cantonese style, the wonton is simply wrapped by bringing the four corners together and squeeze. Cantonese wontons first appeared as street foods, and hawkers got to find the quickest way to wrap up the wontons.</li>
        <li>Zhang Zhongjing (150-219 AD) treated villagers who were suffering from cold and hunger. Many of their ears were mashed because of the cold weather. He used mutton, red pepper and some medicines in wrappers to make "charming ears", which looked like human ears. People felt warm all over and their ears became warm after they ate "charming ears" and drank "dispelling cold soup".</li>
